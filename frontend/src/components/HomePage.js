            `Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by Tomas Flod√©n. The game is played on a 6x6 board divided into four 3x3 sub-boards, or quadrants. 
            Taking turns, each player places a marble of their color (white or black) onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotates one of the quadrants by 90 degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise. 
            A player wins by getting five of their marbles in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row (after the turn of the quadrant). 
            If all marbles are placed onto the board without a row of five being formed then the game is a draw. Also if both players get five in a row at the same time the game also ends in a draw.`
